# Linked Lists
### Coded: May 2020

This was my task as part of the final project of Data Strcutures

## Idea

It was required to store all students' objects and each student's courses in linked lists data structure

## Solution

Obviously, I created two Classes Student and Course to store the data of each, Then I created CourseList linked list to store each course, and then i made StudentList linked list such that each node has the Student object and the address of their CourseList object as parameters
